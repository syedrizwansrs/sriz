    Hi! I'm <strong>Rizwan Syed</strong>, a <em>Technical Operations Manager</em> with over a decade of experience in <strong>SIP, VoIP, Networking, Linux, Automation, and large-scale system monitoring</strong>. I currently work at <em>Connex Carrier Services</em>, where I oversee mission-critical infrastructure, automate operational workflows, and ensure high-availability systems for global telecom carriers.

    With a background in <em>server management, SIP technologies, system monitoring, and customer-focused technical leadership</em>, I enjoy solving complex operational challenges, optimizing performance, and building reliable distributed systems. I’m also a <strong>SSCA® Elite certified specialist</strong>, and my work spans automation, backend architecture, DevOps tooling, and real-time telecom systems.
